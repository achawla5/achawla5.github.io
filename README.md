### Overview

Music has become part of many peopleâ€™s lifestyles over time. It is a form of both personal expression and a kind of social interaction. Music consumption has increased tremendously over the past few years, and a number of companies such as Spotify, Gaana.com, Saavn, Pandora etc. have emerged providing streaming services. With the increasing availability of these streaming services and Bluetooth headsets, we have started to spend more time finding and adding songs to our playlists. By recommender users the music they like, companies are able to lure more customers and thus generate more revenue. With this change in the industry, music recommendations becomes increasingly important for customers in order to lure them into their streaming service. In this notebook, we will analyze and explore the Million Song Dataset, and find relationships between various features. Ultimately, we will also look into recommender systems, and how they're personalized for different individuals based on past history, or finding similar users in such a way that they like similar music.


The dataset we are using is the Million song dataset, which is a freely-available collection of audio features and metadata for a million contemporary popular music tracks. The dataset was taken from:

Since this dataset is approximately 280GB in size, we'll be working with a subset of data in order to conduct our analysis.
